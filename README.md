Python software for a 1-dimensional finite difference time domain simulation of the propagation of an Electromagnetic wave. 
One version (one dimensional FDTD code 3D with mpmath No ZDIR.py) has 3D graph animating the propagation of the wave, the other (1D FDTD Lens Array.py) has the end result of the wave traveling through an array of lenses with differing indexes of refraction
